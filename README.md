To run these scripts, you must install [Python](https://www.python.org/).

For the `poster_price.py` script, you must install [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) using the following steps:

  1. Open command prompt and type `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools virtualenv`.
  2. Then, type `python -m pip install kivy[full] kivy_examples`

Thanks for using :)
